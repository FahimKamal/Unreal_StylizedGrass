# Unreal Stylized Grass 

Stylized grass can simulate wind effect. This project was first created to make similar grass I already
created on Unity. [Unity Stylized Grass Wind Effect](https://github.com/FahimKamal/Unity_StylizedGrassWindEffect).
Was able to find a good Youtube tutorial to follow and was able to add some more amazing features with it. 
Watch the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/AEMe-kcZBLw?si=otkbbhEFYBcb7pc4).

- By texturing the terrain with different colors, the color of the grass will also change with it. Making it more 
natural. 
- You will see color change depending on camera position from the grass.
